# Agent Orchestration

## Available Agents

Located in `~/.claude/agents/`:

| Agent | Purpose | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| planner | Implementation planning | Complex features, refactoring |
| architect | System design | Architectural decisions |
| tdd-guide | Test-driven development | New features, bug fixes |
| code-reviewer | Code review | After writing code |
| security-reviewer | Security analysis | Before commits |
| build-error-resolver | Fix build errors | When build fails |
| e2e-runner | E2E testing | Critical user flows |
| refactor-cleaner | Dead code cleanup | Code maintenance |
| doc-updater | Documentation | Updating docs |
| rust-reviewer | Rust code review | Rust projects |

## Immediate Agent Usage

No user prompt needed:
1. Complex feature requests - Use **planner** agent
2. Code just written/modified - Use **code-reviewer** agent
3. Bug fix or new feature - Use **tdd-guide** agent
4. Architectural decision - Use **architect** agent

## Parallel Task Execution

ALWAYS use parallel Task execution for independent operations:

```markdown
# GOOD: Parallel execution
Launch 3 agents in parallel:
1. Agent 1: Security analysis of auth module
2. Agent 2: Performance review of cache system
3. Agent 3: Type checking of utilities

# BAD: Sequential when unnecessary
First agent 1, then agent 2, then agent 3
```

## Multi-Perspective Analysis

For complex problems, use split role sub-agents:
- Factual reviewer
- Senior engineer
- Security expert
- Consistency reviewer
- Redundancy checker
# Code Review Standards

## Purpose

Code review ensures quality, security, and maintainability before code is merged. This rule defines when and how to conduct code reviews.

## When to Review

**MANDATORY review triggers:**

- After writing or modifying code
- Before any commit to shared branches
- When security-sensitive code is changed (auth, payments, user data)
- When architectural changes are made
- Before merging pull requests

**Pre-Review Requirements:**

Before requesting review, ensure:

- All automated checks (CI/CD) are passing
- Merge conflicts are resolved
- Branch is up to date with target branch

## Review Checklist

Before marking code complete:

- [ ] Code is readable and well-named
- [ ] Functions are focused (<50 lines)
- [ ] Files are cohesive (<800 lines)
- [ ] No deep nesting (>4 levels)
- [ ] Errors are handled explicitly
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] No console.log or debug statements
- [ ] Tests exist for new functionality
- [ ] Test coverage meets 80% minimum

## Security Review Triggers

**STOP and use security-reviewer agent when:**

- Authentication or authorization code
- User input handling
- Database queries
- File system operations
- External API calls
- Cryptographic operations
- Payment or financial code

## Review Severity Levels

| Level | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| CRITICAL | Security vulnerability or data loss risk | **BLOCK** - Must fix before merge |
| HIGH | Bug or significant quality issue | **WARN** - Should fix before merge |
| MEDIUM | Maintainability concern | **INFO** - Consider fixing |
| LOW | Style or minor suggestion | **NOTE** - Optional |

## Agent Usage

Use these agents for code review:

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **code-reviewer** | General code quality, patterns, best practices |
| **security-reviewer** | Security vulnerabilities, OWASP Top 10 |
| **typescript-reviewer** | TypeScript/JavaScript specific issues |
| **python-reviewer** | Python specific issues |
| **go-reviewer** | Go specific issues |
| **rust-reviewer** | Rust specific issues |

## Review Workflow

```
1. Run git diff to understand changes
2. Check security checklist first
3. Review code quality checklist
4. Run relevant tests
5. Verify coverage >= 80%
6. Use appropriate agent for detailed review
```

## Common Issues to Catch

### Security

- Hardcoded credentials (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- SQL injection (string concatenation in queries)
- XSS vulnerabilities (unescaped user input)
- Path traversal (unsanitized file paths)
- CSRF protection missing
- Authentication bypasses

### Code Quality

- Large functions (>50 lines) - split into smaller
- Large files (>800 lines) - extract modules
- Deep nesting (>4 levels) - use early returns
- Missing error handling - handle explicitly
- Mutation patterns - prefer immutable operations
- Missing tests - add test coverage

### Performance

- N+1 queries - use JOINs or batching
- Missing pagination - add LIMIT to queries
- Unbounded queries - add constraints
- Missing caching - cache expensive operations

## Approval Criteria

- **Approve**: No CRITICAL or HIGH issues
- **Warning**: Only HIGH issues (merge with caution)
- **Block**: CRITICAL issues found

## Integration with Other Rules

This rule works with:

- [testing.md](testing.md) - Test coverage requirements
- [security.md](security.md) - Security checklist
- [git-workflow.md](git-workflow.md) - Commit standards
- [agents.md](agents.md) - Agent delegation
# Coding Style

## Immutability (CRITICAL)

ALWAYS create new objects, NEVER mutate existing ones:

```
// Pseudocode
WRONG:  modify(original, field, value) → changes original in-place
CORRECT: update(original, field, value) → returns new copy with change
```

Rationale: Immutable data prevents hidden side effects, makes debugging easier, and enables safe concurrency.

## Core Principles

### KISS (Keep It Simple)

- Prefer the simplest solution that actually works
- Avoid premature optimization
- Optimize for clarity over cleverness

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- Extract repeated logic into shared functions or utilities
- Avoid copy-paste implementation drift
- Introduce abstractions when repetition is real, not speculative

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

- Do not build features or abstractions before they are needed
- Avoid speculative generality
- Start simple, then refactor when the pressure is real

## File Organization

MANY SMALL FILES > FEW LARGE FILES:
- High cohesion, low coupling
- 200-400 lines typical, 800 max
- Extract utilities from large modules
- Organize by feature/domain, not by type

## Error Handling

ALWAYS handle errors comprehensively:
- Handle errors explicitly at every level
- Provide user-friendly error messages in UI-facing code
- Log detailed error context on the server side
- Never silently swallow errors

## Input Validation

ALWAYS validate at system boundaries:
- Validate all user input before processing
- Use schema-based validation where available
- Fail fast with clear error messages
- Never trust external data (API responses, user input, file content)

## Naming Conventions

- Variables and functions: `camelCase` with descriptive names
- Booleans: prefer `is`, `has`, `should`, or `can` prefixes
- Interfaces, types, and components: `PascalCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Custom hooks: `camelCase` with a `use` prefix

## Code Smells to Avoid

### Deep Nesting

Prefer early returns over nested conditionals once the logic starts stacking.

### Magic Numbers

Use named constants for meaningful thresholds, delays, and limits.

### Long Functions

Split large functions into focused pieces with clear responsibilities.

## Code Quality Checklist

Before marking work complete:
- [ ] Code is readable and well-named
- [ ] Functions are small (<50 lines)
- [ ] Files are focused (<800 lines)
- [ ] No deep nesting (>4 levels)
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] No hardcoded values (use constants or config)
- [ ] No mutation (immutable patterns used)
# Development Workflow

> This file extends [common/git-workflow.md](./git-workflow.md) with the full feature development process that happens before git operations.

The Feature Implementation Workflow describes the development pipeline: research, planning, TDD, code review, and then committing to git.

## Feature Implementation Workflow

0. **Research & Reuse** _(mandatory before any new implementation)_
   - **GitHub code search first:** Run `gh search repos` and `gh search code` to find existing implementations, templates, and patterns before writing anything new.
   - **Library docs second:** Use Context7 or primary vendor docs to confirm API behavior, package usage, and version-specific details before implementing.
   - **Exa only when the first two are insufficient:** Use Exa for broader web research or discovery after GitHub search and primary docs.
   - **Check package registries:** Search npm, PyPI, crates.io, and other registries before writing utility code. Prefer battle-tested libraries over hand-rolled solutions.
   - **Search for adaptable implementations:** Look for open-source projects that solve 80%+ of the problem and can be forked, ported, or wrapped.
   - Prefer adopting or porting a proven approach over writing net-new code when it meets the requirement.

1. **Plan First**
   - Use **planner** agent to create implementation plan
   - Generate planning docs before coding: PRD, architecture, system_design, tech_doc, task_list
   - Identify dependencies and risks
   - Break down into phases

2. **TDD Approach**
   - Use **tdd-guide** agent
   - Write tests first (RED)
   - Implement to pass tests (GREEN)
   - Refactor (IMPROVE)
   - Verify 80%+ coverage

3. **Code Review**
   - Use **code-reviewer** agent immediately after writing code
   - Address CRITICAL and HIGH issues
   - Fix MEDIUM issues when possible

4. **Commit & Push**
   - Detailed commit messages
   - Follow conventional commits format
   - See [git-workflow.md](./git-workflow.md) for commit message format and PR process

5. **Pre-Review Checks**
   - Verify all automated checks (CI/CD) are passing
   - Resolve any merge conflicts
   - Ensure branch is up to date with target branch
   - Only request review after these checks pass
# Git Workflow

## Commit Message Format
```
<type>: <description>

<optional body>
```

Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, perf, ci

Note: Attribution disabled globally via ~/.claude/settings.json.

## Pull Request Workflow

When creating PRs:
1. Analyze full commit history (not just latest commit)
2. Use `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to see all changes
3. Draft comprehensive PR summary
4. Include test plan with TODOs
5. Push with `-u` flag if new branch

> For the full development process (planning, TDD, code review) before git operations,
> see [development-workflow.md](./development-workflow.md).
# Hooks System

## Hook Types

- **PreToolUse**: Before tool execution (validation, parameter modification)
- **PostToolUse**: After tool execution (auto-format, checks)
- **Stop**: When session ends (final verification)

## Auto-Accept Permissions

Use with caution:
- Enable for trusted, well-defined plans
- Disable for exploratory work
- Never use dangerously-skip-permissions flag
- Configure `allowedTools` in `~/.claude.json` instead

## TodoWrite Best Practices

Use TodoWrite tool to:
- Track progress on multi-step tasks
- Verify understanding of instructions
- Enable real-time steering
- Show granular implementation steps

Todo list reveals:
- Out of order steps
- Missing items
- Extra unnecessary items
- Wrong granularity
- Misinterpreted requirements
# Common Patterns

## Skeleton Projects

When implementing new functionality:
1. Search for battle-tested skeleton projects
2. Use parallel agents to evaluate options:
   - Security assessment
   - Extensibility analysis
   - Relevance scoring
   - Implementation planning
3. Clone best match as foundation
4. Iterate within proven structure

## Design Patterns

### Repository Pattern

Encapsulate data access behind a consistent interface:
- Define standard operations: findAll, findById, create, update, delete
- Concrete implementations handle storage details (database, API, file, etc.)
- Business logic depends on the abstract interface, not the storage mechanism
- Enables easy swapping of data sources and simplifies testing with mocks

### API Response Format

Use a consistent envelope for all API responses:
- Include a success/status indicator
- Include the data payload (nullable on error)
- Include an error message field (nullable on success)
- Include metadata for paginated responses (total, page, limit)
# Performance Optimization

## Model Selection Strategy

**Haiku 4.5** (90% of Sonnet capability, 3x cost savings):
- Lightweight agents with frequent invocation
- Pair programming and code generation
- Worker agents in multi-agent systems

**Sonnet 4.6** (Best coding model):
- Main development work
- Orchestrating multi-agent workflows
- Complex coding tasks

**Opus 4.5** (Deepest reasoning):
- Complex architectural decisions
- Maximum reasoning requirements
- Research and analysis tasks

## Context Window Management

Avoid last 20% of context window for:
- Large-scale refactoring
- Feature implementation spanning multiple files
- Debugging complex interactions

Lower context sensitivity tasks:
- Single-file edits
- Independent utility creation
- Documentation updates
- Simple bug fixes

## Extended Thinking + Plan Mode

Extended thinking is enabled by default, reserving up to 31,999 tokens for internal reasoning.

Control extended thinking via:
- **Toggle**: Option+T (macOS) / Alt+T (Windows/Linux)
- **Config**: Set `alwaysThinkingEnabled` in `~/.claude/settings.json`
- **Budget cap**: `export MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=10000`
- **Verbose mode**: Ctrl+O to see thinking output

For complex tasks requiring deep reasoning:
1. Ensure extended thinking is enabled (on by default)
2. Enable **Plan Mode** for structured approach
3. Use multiple critique rounds for thorough analysis
4. Use split role sub-agents for diverse perspectives

## Build Troubleshooting

If build fails:
1. Use **build-error-resolver** agent
2. Analyze error messages
3. Fix incrementally
4. Verify after each fix
# Security Guidelines

## Mandatory Security Checks

Before ANY commit:
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- [ ] All user inputs validated
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS prevention (sanitized HTML)
- [ ] CSRF protection enabled
- [ ] Authentication/authorization verified
- [ ] Rate limiting on all endpoints
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive data

## Secret Management

- NEVER hardcode secrets in source code
- ALWAYS use environment variables or a secret manager
- Validate that required secrets are present at startup
- Rotate any secrets that may have been exposed

## Security Response Protocol

If security issue found:
1. STOP immediately
2. Use **security-reviewer** agent
3. Fix CRITICAL issues before continuing
4. Rotate any exposed secrets
5. Review entire codebase for similar issues
# Testing Requirements

## Minimum Test Coverage: 80%

Test Types (ALL required):
1. **Unit Tests** - Individual functions, utilities, components
2. **Integration Tests** - API endpoints, database operations
3. **E2E Tests** - Critical user flows (framework chosen per language)

## Test-Driven Development

MANDATORY workflow:
1. Write test first (RED)
2. Run test - it should FAIL
3. Write minimal implementation (GREEN)
4. Run test - it should PASS
5. Refactor (IMPROVE)
6. Verify coverage (80%+)

## Troubleshooting Test Failures

1. Use **tdd-guide** agent
2. Check test isolation
3. Verify mocks are correct
4. Fix implementation, not tests (unless tests are wrong)

## Agent Support

- **tdd-guide** - Use PROACTIVELY for new features, enforces write-tests-first

## Test Structure (AAA Pattern)

Prefer Arrange-Act-Assert structure for tests:

```typescript
test('calculates similarity correctly', () => {
  // Arrange
  const vector1 = [1, 0, 0]
  const vector2 = [0, 1, 0]

  // Act
  const similarity = calculateCosineSimilarity(vector1, vector2)

  // Assert
  expect(similarity).toBe(0)
})
```

### Test Naming

Use descriptive names that explain the behavior under test:

```typescript
test('returns empty array when no markets match query', () => {})
test('throws error when API key is missing', () => {})
test('falls back to substring search when Redis is unavailable', () => {})
```

# TypeScript/JavaScript Coding Style

> This file extends [common/coding-style.md](../common/coding-style.md) with TypeScript/JavaScript specific content.

## Types and Interfaces

Use types to make public APIs, shared models, and component props explicit, readable, and reusable.

### Public APIs

- Add parameter and return types to exported functions, shared utilities, and public class methods
- Let TypeScript infer obvious local variable types
- Extract repeated inline object shapes into named types or interfaces

```typescript
// WRONG: Exported function without explicit types
export function formatUser(user) {
  return `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`
}

// CORRECT: Explicit types on public APIs
interface User {
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
}

export function formatUser(user: User): string {
  return `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`
}
```

### Interfaces vs. Type Aliases

- Use `interface` for object shapes that may be extended or implemented
- Use `type` for unions, intersections, tuples, mapped types, and utility types
- Prefer string literal unions over `enum` unless an `enum` is required for interoperability

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string
  email: string
}

type UserRole = 'admin' | 'member'
type UserWithRole = User & {
  role: UserRole
}
```

### Avoid `any`

- Avoid `any` in application code
- Use `unknown` for external or untrusted input, then narrow it safely
- Use generics when a value's type depends on the caller

```typescript
// WRONG: any removes type safety
function getErrorMessage(error: any) {
  return error.message
}

// CORRECT: unknown forces safe narrowing
function getErrorMessage(error: unknown): string {
  if (error instanceof Error) {
    return error.message
  }

  return 'Unexpected error'
}
```

### React Props

- Define component props with a named `interface` or `type`
- Type callback props explicitly
- Do not use `React.FC` unless there is a specific reason to do so

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string
  email: string
}

interface UserCardProps {
  user: User
  onSelect: (id: string) => void
}

function UserCard({ user, onSelect }: UserCardProps) {
  return <button onClick={() => onSelect(user.id)}>{user.email}</button>
}
```

### JavaScript Files

- In `.js` and `.jsx` files, use JSDoc when types improve clarity and a TypeScript migration is not practical
- Keep JSDoc aligned with runtime behavior

```javascript
/**
 * @param {{ firstName: string, lastName: string }} user
 * @returns {string}
 */
export function formatUser(user) {
  return `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`
}
```

## Immutability

Use spread operator for immutable updates:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string
  name: string
}

// WRONG: Mutation
function updateUser(user: User, name: string): User {
  user.name = name // MUTATION!
  return user
}

// CORRECT: Immutability
function updateUser(user: Readonly<User>, name: string): User {
  return {
    ...user,
    name
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

Use async/await with try-catch and narrow unknown errors safely:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string
  email: string
}

declare function riskyOperation(userId: string): Promise<User>

function getErrorMessage(error: unknown): string {
  if (error instanceof Error) {
    return error.message
  }

  return 'Unexpected error'
}

const logger = {
  error: (message: string, error: unknown) => {
    // Replace with your production logger (for example, pino or winston).
  }
}

async function loadUser(userId: string): Promise<User> {
  try {
    const result = await riskyOperation(userId)
    return result
  } catch (error: unknown) {
    logger.error('Operation failed', error)
    throw new Error(getErrorMessage(error))
  }
}
```

## Input Validation

Use Zod for schema-based validation and infer types from the schema:

```typescript
import { z } from 'zod'

const userSchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  age: z.number().int().min(0).max(150)
})

type UserInput = z.infer<typeof userSchema>

const validated: UserInput = userSchema.parse(input)
```

## Console.log

- No `console.log` statements in production code
- Use proper logging libraries instead
- See hooks for automatic detection

- **Prettier**: Auto-format JS/TS files after edit
- **TypeScript check**: Run `tsc` after editing `.ts`/`.tsx` files
- **console.log warning**: Warn about `console.log` in edited files

## Stop Hooks

- **console.log audit**: Check all modified files for `console.log` before session ends

  error?: string
  meta?: {
    total: number
    page: number
    limit: number
  }

# Web Coding Style

## File Organization

Organize by feature or surface area, not by file type:

```text
src/
├── components/
│   ├── hero/
│   │   ├── Hero.tsx
│   │   ├── HeroVisual.tsx
│   │   └── hero.css
│   ├── scrolly-section/
│   │   ├── ScrollySection.tsx
│   │   ├── StickyVisual.tsx
│   │   └── scrolly.css
│   └── ui/
│       ├── Button.tsx
│       ├── SurfaceCard.tsx
│       └── AnimatedText.tsx
├── hooks/
│   ├── useReducedMotion.ts
│   └── useScrollProgress.ts
├── lib/
│   ├── animation.ts
│   └── color.ts
└── styles/
    ├── tokens.css
    ├── typography.css
    └── global.css
```

## CSS Custom Properties

Define design tokens as variables. Do not hardcode palette, typography, or spacing repeatedly:

```css
:root {
  --color-surface: oklch(98% 0 0);
  --color-text: oklch(18% 0 0);
  --color-accent: oklch(68% 0.21 250);

  --text-base: clamp(1rem, 0.92rem + 0.4vw, 1.125rem);
  --text-hero: clamp(3rem, 1rem + 7vw, 8rem);

  --space-section: clamp(4rem, 3rem + 5vw, 10rem);

  --duration-fast: 150ms;
  --duration-normal: 300ms;
  --ease-out-expo: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);
}
```

## Animation-Only Properties

Prefer compositor-friendly motion:
- `transform`
- `opacity`
- `clip-path`
- `filter` (sparingly)

Avoid animating layout-bound properties:
- `width`
- `height`
- `top`
- `left`
- `margin`
- `padding`
- `border`
- `font-size`

## Semantic HTML First

```html
<header>
  <nav aria-label="Main navigation">...</nav>
</header>
<main>
  <section aria-labelledby="hero-heading">
    <h1 id="hero-heading">...</h1>
  </section>
</main>
<footer>...</footer>
```

Do not reach for generic wrapper `div` stacks when a semantic element exists.

## Naming

- Components: PascalCase (`ScrollySection`, `SurfaceCard`)
- Hooks: `use` prefix (`useReducedMotion`)
- CSS classes: kebab-case or utility classes
- Animation timelines: camelCase with intent (`heroRevealTl`)
> This file extends [common/patterns.md](../common/patterns.md) with web-specific design-quality guidance.

# Web Design Quality Standards

## Anti-Template Policy

Do not ship generic template-looking UI. Frontend output should look intentional, opinionated, and specific to the product.

### Banned Patterns

- Default card grids with uniform spacing and no hierarchy
- Stock hero section with centered headline, gradient blob, and generic CTA
- Unmodified library defaults passed off as finished design
- Flat layouts with no layering, depth, or motion
- Uniform radius, spacing, and shadows across every component
- Safe gray-on-white styling with one decorative accent color
- Dashboard-by-numbers layouts with sidebar + cards + charts and no point of view
- Default font stacks used without a deliberate reason

### Required Qualities

Every meaningful frontend surface should demonstrate at least four of these:

1. Clear hierarchy through scale contrast
2. Intentional rhythm in spacing, not uniform padding everywhere
3. Depth or layering through overlap, shadows, surfaces, or motion
4. Typography with character and a real pairing strategy
5. Color used semantically, not just decoratively
6. Hover, focus, and active states that feel designed
7. Grid-breaking editorial or bento composition where appropriate
8. Texture, grain, or atmosphere when it fits the visual direction
9. Motion that clarifies flow instead of distracting from it
10. Data visualization treated as part of the design system, not an afterthought

## Before Writing Frontend Code

1. Pick a specific style direction. Avoid vague defaults like "clean minimal".
2. Define a palette intentionally.
3. Choose typography deliberately.
4. Gather at least a small set of real references.
5. Use ECC design/frontend skills where relevant.

## Worthwhile Style Directions

- Editorial / magazine
- Neo-brutalism
- Glassmorphism with real depth
- Dark luxury or light luxury with disciplined contrast
- Bento layouts
- Scrollytelling
- 3D integration
- Swiss / International
- Retro-futurism

Do not default to dark mode automatically. Choose the visual direction the product actually wants.

## Component Checklist

- [ ] Does it avoid looking like a default Tailwind or shadcn template?
- [ ] Does it have intentional hover/focus/active states?
- [ ] Does it use hierarchy rather than uniform emphasis?
- [ ] Would this look believable in a real product screenshot?
- [ ] If it supports both themes, do both light and dark feel intentional?
> This file extends [common/hooks.md](../common/hooks.md) with web-specific hook recommendations.

# Web Hooks

## Recommended PostToolUse Hooks

Prefer project-local tooling. Do not wire hooks to remote one-off package execution.

### Format on Save

Use the project's existing formatter entrypoint after edits:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "command": "pnpm prettier --write \"$FILE_PATH\"",
        "description": "Format edited frontend files"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Equivalent local commands via `yarn prettier` or `npm exec prettier --` are fine when they use repo-owned dependencies.

### Lint Check

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "command": "pnpm eslint --fix \"$FILE_PATH\"",
        "description": "Run ESLint on edited frontend files"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Type Check

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "command": "pnpm tsc --noEmit --pretty false",
        "description": "Type-check after frontend edits"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### CSS Lint

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "command": "pnpm stylelint --fix \"$FILE_PATH\"",
        "description": "Lint edited stylesheets"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## PreToolUse Hooks

### Guard File Size

Block oversized writes from tool input content, not from a file that may not exist yet:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write",
        "command": "node -e \"let d='';process.stdin.on('data',c=>d+=c);process.stdin.on('end',()=>{const i=JSON.parse(d);const c=i.tool_input?.content||'';const lines=c.split('\\n').length;if(lines>800){console.error('[Hook] BLOCKED: File exceeds 800 lines ('+lines+' lines)');console.error('[Hook] Split into smaller modules');process.exit(2)}console.log(d)})\"",
        "description": "Block writes that exceed 800 lines"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Stop Hooks

### Final Build Verification

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "command": "pnpm build",
        "description": "Verify the production build at session end"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

# Web Patterns

## Component Composition

### Compound Components

Use compound components when related UI shares state and interaction semantics:

```tsx
<Tabs defaultValue="overview">
  <Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Trigger value="overview">Overview</Tabs.Trigger>
    <Tabs.Trigger value="settings">Settings</Tabs.Trigger>
  </Tabs.List>
  <Tabs.Content value="overview">...</Tabs.Content>
  <Tabs.Content value="settings">...</Tabs.Content>
</Tabs>
```

- Parent owns state
- Children consume via context
- Prefer this over prop drilling for complex widgets

### Render Props / Slots

- Use render props or slot patterns when behavior is shared but markup must vary
- Keep keyboard handling, ARIA, and focus logic in the headless layer

### Container / Presentational Split

- Container components own data loading and side effects
- Presentational components receive props and render UI
- Presentational components should stay pure

## State Management

Treat these separately:

| Concern | Tooling |
|---------|---------|
| Server state | TanStack Query, SWR, tRPC |
| Client state | Zustand, Jotai, signals |
| URL state | search params, route segments |
| Form state | React Hook Form or equivalent |

- Do not duplicate server state into client stores
- Derive values instead of storing redundant computed state

## URL As State

Persist shareable state in the URL:
- filters
- sort order
- pagination
- active tab
- search query

## Data Fetching

### Stale-While-Revalidate

- Return cached data immediately
- Revalidate in the background
- Prefer existing libraries instead of rolling this by hand

### Optimistic Updates

- Snapshot current state
- Apply optimistic update
- Roll back on failure
- Emit visible error feedback when rolling back

### Parallel Loading

- Fetch independent data in parallel
- Avoid parent-child request waterfalls
- Prefetch likely next routes or states when justified

# Web Performance Rules

## Core Web Vitals Targets

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| LCP | < 2.5s |
| INP | < 200ms |
| CLS | < 0.1 |
| FCP | < 1.5s |
| TBT | < 200ms |

## Bundle Budget

| Page Type | JS Budget (gzipped) | CSS Budget |
|-----------|---------------------|------------|
| Landing page | < 150kb | < 30kb |
| App page | < 300kb | < 50kb |
| Microsite | < 80kb | < 15kb |

## Loading Strategy

1. Inline critical above-the-fold CSS where justified
2. Preload the hero image and primary font only
3. Defer non-critical CSS or JS
4. Dynamically import heavy libraries

```js
const gsapModule = await import('gsap');
const { ScrollTrigger } = await import('gsap/ScrollTrigger');
```

## Image Optimization

- Explicit `width` and `height`
- `loading="eager"` plus `fetchpriority="high"` for hero media only
- `loading="lazy"` for below-the-fold assets
- Prefer AVIF or WebP with fallbacks
- Never ship source images far beyond rendered size

## Font Loading

- Max two font families unless there is a clear exception
- `font-display: swap`
- Subset where possible
- Preload only the truly critical weight/style

## Animation Performance

- Animate compositor-friendly properties only
- Use `will-change` narrowly and remove it when done
- Prefer CSS for simple transitions
- Use `requestAnimationFrame` or established animation libraries for JS motion
- Avoid scroll handler churn; use IntersectionObserver or well-behaved libraries

## Performance Checklist

- [ ] All images have explicit dimensions
- [ ] No accidental render-blocking resources
- [ ] No layout shifts from dynamic content
- [ ] Motion stays on compositor-friendly properties
- [ ] Third-party scripts load async/defer and only when needed
> This file extends [common/security.md](../common/security.md) with web-specific security content.

# Web Security Rules

## Content Security Policy

Always configure a production CSP.

### Nonce-Based CSP

Use a per-request nonce for scripts instead of `'unsafe-inline'`.

```text
Content-Security-Policy:
  default-src 'self';
  script-src 'self' 'nonce-{RANDOM}' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net;
  style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com;
  img-src 'self' data: https:;
  font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com;
  connect-src 'self' https://*.example.com;
  frame-src 'none';
  object-src 'none';
  base-uri 'self';
```

Adjust origins to the project. Do not cargo-cult this block unchanged.

## XSS Prevention

- Never inject unsanitized HTML
- Avoid `innerHTML` / `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless sanitized first
- Escape dynamic template values
- Sanitize user HTML with a vetted local sanitizer when absolutely necessary

## Third-Party Scripts

- Load asynchronously
- Use SRI when serving from a CDN
- Audit quarterly
- Prefer self-hosting for critical dependencies when practical

## HTTPS and Headers

```text
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()
```

## Forms

- CSRF protection on state-changing forms
- Rate limiting on submission endpoints
- Validate client and server side
- Prefer honeypots or light anti-abuse controls over heavy-handed CAPTCHA defaults
> This file extends [common/testing.md](../common/testing.md) with web-specific testing content.

# Web Testing Rules

## Priority Order

### 1. Visual Regression

- Screenshot key breakpoints: 320, 768, 1024, 1440
- Test hero sections, scrollytelling sections, and meaningful states
- Use Playwright screenshots for visual-heavy work
- If both themes exist, test both

### 2. Accessibility

- Run automated accessibility checks
- Test keyboard navigation
- Verify reduced-motion behavior
- Verify color contrast

### 3. Performance

- Run Lighthouse or equivalent against meaningful pages
- Keep CWV targets from [performance.md](performance.md)

### 4. Cross-Browser

- Minimum: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Test scrolling, motion, and fallback behavior

### 5. Responsive

- Test 320, 375, 768, 1024, 1440, 1920
- Verify no overflow
- Verify touch interactions

## E2E Shape

```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('landing hero loads', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  await expect(page.locator('h1')).toBeVisible();
});
```

- Avoid flaky timeout-based assertions
- Prefer deterministic waits

## Unit Tests

- Test utilities, data transforms, and custom hooks
- For highly visual components, visual regression often carries more signal than brittle markup assertions
- Visual regression supplements coverage targets; it does not replace them
